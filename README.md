## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned more about SVG, but I still need to learn more. I couldn't figure out a good way to dynamically resize an SVG. I wanted to make the "X" icon on smaller on the mobile layout, but it look strange.

### Continued development

I made a feeble attempt to implement drag and drop using vanilla JS. However, using an JS library or framework would be much easier.
